bean = instantiated --> some initialization may be needed to get it into a stable state
bean = destroyed --> some cleanup may be needed

* have to declare the <bean> with initmethod and/or destroy-method parameters
initmethod- calls upon a method that's call on the bean on instantiation
destroymethod- calls upon a method that's call on the bean before removal from container

InitializingBean and DisposableBEan are built-in/given for free(?)

INIT-METHOD
	xml based configuration
		<bean id = "exampleBean" class = "examples.ExampleBean" init-method = "init"/>
	class definition
		public class ExampleBean {
  			public void init() {
      			// do some initialization work
   			}
		}
		
(destroy is similar but for destruction and destroy-method)
using default-init-method or default-destroy-method will ensure those init methods and destroy method
for all the beans that you require. they are outside + before the <bean id = "..." > etc.
